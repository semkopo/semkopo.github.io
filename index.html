    <p>Welcome to my astonishing GitHub website, which tells you about a weird sea creature
   </p>
    <h2>Portuguese Man o' War</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The Portuguese man o’ war is a highly venomous open ocean predator that superficially resembles a jellyfish but is actually a siphonophore.
        <br> 
        Each man o’ war is actually a colony of several small individual organisms that each have a specialized job and are so closely intertwined that they cannot survive alone. 
        <br>
        In this manner, the larger colony consists of a float that keeps the colony at the sea surface, a series of long tentacles that are covered with stinging cells, a rudimentary digestive system, and a simple reproductive system.</p>

<p class="funfact">The species is named for its resemblance to a class of warships that was developed in Portugal beginning in the 15th century with the caravel</p>

       <p class="spreading">Portuguese man-of-wars are found in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. They are surface animals and live in tropical and subtropical waters.
           The species is especially common in the warm waters of the Sargasso Sea, but they are also found in the vicinity of Florida Keys, the Gulf Stream, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea
